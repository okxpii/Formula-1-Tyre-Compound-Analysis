This is my final project from ORIE 3120 (Practical tools for Operationes Research, Machine Learning, and Data Science) in the Spring 2022, where I used a formula 1 dataset to analyze qualifying performance and tyre life.
Using python and the Pandas, SciKit, and FastF1 libraries, I performed a multinomial logistic regression to predict tyre type using the 2021 Russian Grand Prix as an example.
